    Medieval Octopus: Critical Curry
  </h1>
  <p>
    The vast majority of octopi from the medieval period knew that many curries could potentially become rather critical.<br/>
    Until now, they were the only ones.
  </p><p>
    However, that has changed. Now we feeble humans can also understand the criticality of curry dishes when served at many outlets across the world.<br/>
    We can defend ourselves from the curry.<br/>
    We can win.
